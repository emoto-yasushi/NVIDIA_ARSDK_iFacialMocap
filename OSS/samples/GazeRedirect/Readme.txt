GazeRedirect is a sample Windows application that demonstrates the gaze redirection feature of the NVIDIA AR SDK. The application requires a video feed
from a camera connected to the computer running the application, or from a video file, as specified
with command-line arguments (enumerated by executing: GazeRedirect.exe --help). 

Here are a few controls for the gaze feature: 
'o'/'O' - Display original image and the redirected image side-by-side
'w'/'W' - Display visualization of landmarks and head translation values.
't'/'T' - Display head translation values when visualization is on.

For more controls and configurations of the sample app, please read the SDK programming guide.
